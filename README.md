Project : Money Tracker

Money Tracker is a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap< JQuery, Ajax and Flask.
Money Tracker helps you to log your everyday expenses. Each expense can be categorized.
The user can see a list of expenses grouped by a selected month and also a doughnut chart that visualizes
how much money is going into each category.

Money Tracker also allows you to add to a To Do list, and when a item is checked it goes automatically 
into your expenses.
